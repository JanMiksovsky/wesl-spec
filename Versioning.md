# Versioning Enhanced WGSL

(TBD)

As we stabilize for 1.0, we should mark a way for tools (and users) to distinguish our first stable version
from subsequent releases.

Issues:

* Feature flags or versions?
* perhaps `version WESL2024`?
* Does the version need to go in wgsl or just in metadata like wgsl.toml.
* We'd like tools to maintain backward compatibility with previous stable versions. What do tools need?
